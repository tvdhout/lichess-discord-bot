Interact with the bot exclusively through slash commands.

* `/connect` → connect your Lichess account to your Discord profile
* `/disconnect` → disconnect your Lichess account from your Discord profile (and delete your data)
* `/puzzle random` → show a random lichess puzzle, or one near your puzzle rating if your Lichess account is connected using `/connect`
* `/puzzle id` → show a specific chess puzzle by ID
* `/puzzle rating` → show a random chess puzzle with a difficulty rating in your specified range
* `/puzzle theme [ignore_rating]` → show a random chess puzzle with a specific popular theme
* `/watch` → watch a (live) Lichess game
